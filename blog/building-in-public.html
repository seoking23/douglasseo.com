                <p class="lead">
                    When I launched Popper last year, I made a commitment to build in
                    public. Sharing both successes and failures has been challenging but
                    incredibly rewarding. Here's what I've learned from growing
                    our user base to 1,100+ users and partnering with 60+ local businesses.
                </p>

                <h2>The Power of Transparency</h2>

                <p>
                    Building in public isn't just about sharing metrics—it's about
                    being honest about the journey. When we hit our first 100 users, I
                    shared not just the milestone but the three failed marketing approaches
                    that preceded it. That post resonated more than any product announcement
                    and led to connections with other founders who became valuable advisors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The real magic happened when I started sharing our technical challenges.
                    A post about our Firebase scaling issues caught the attention of an
                    engineer who had solved similar problems. That chance connection saved
                    us weeks of troubleshooting and led to a 40% improvement in our
                    app's performance.
                </p>

                <h2>Real Metrics Drive Accountability</h2>

                <p>
                    When you commit to sharing your numbers publicly, you can't hide
                    from reality. Our monthly updates include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>User growth (currently 1,100+)</li>
                    <li>Business partnerships (60+ and growing)</li>
                    <li>Engagement metrics (3.2 transactions per user weekly)</li>
                    <li>Retention (78% 30-day retention)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    This transparency creates accountability that's impossible to
                    achieve when metrics remain private. There were months when growth
                    stalled, and knowing I'd have to report those numbers publicly
                    pushed me to experiment with new acquisition channels rather than making
                    excuses.
                </p>

                <h2>Engineering Trade-offs in the Open</h2>

                <p>
                    As a technical founder, I've found particular value in discussing
                    engineering decisions publicly. When we chose React Native for
                    cross-platform development, I wrote about the trade-offs involved. That
                    post sparked valuable discussions about performance optimizations we
                    hadn't considered.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Similarly, documenting our journey with Firebase—from simple MVP to
                    supporting thousands of transactions—has created a record of technical
                    decisions that helps us avoid repeating mistakes and provides context
                    for new team members.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of our most difficult decisions was whether to rebuild our rewards
                    calculation engine for better scalability or optimize the existing
                    system. By sharing our analysis publicly, we received feedback that
                    ultimately saved us from a premature rewrite, focusing instead on
                    targeted optimizations that achieved the same goals with less risk.
                </p>

                <h2>Community as a Competitive Advantage</h2>

                <p>
                    The most unexpected benefit of building in public has been the community
                    that's formed around our journey. Our users feel invested in our
                    success because they've watched us grow from the beginning. When we
                    ask for feedback, we get thoughtful responses rather than generic
                    suggestions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This community became a genuine competitive advantage when a larger
                    competitor entered our market. Our users didn't just stay
                    loyal—they became advocates, bringing friends onto the platform and
                    suggesting new businesses for us to partner with. That organic growth
                    would have cost thousands in marketing spend to achieve otherwise.
                </p>

                <h2>The Challenges of Public Building</h2>

                <p>
                    Building in public isn't without its challenges. There's a
                    fine line between transparency and oversharing, especially regarding
                    financial metrics or strategic plans. We've developed a simple
                    framework: share freely about the past and present, but be more
                    selective about future plans that might change or create competitive
                    disadvantages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There's also the emotional toll of public failure. When our first
                    Android release had critical bugs affecting 20% of users, documenting
                    that failure publicly was painful but ultimately strengthened trust with
                    our community. They saw how quickly we responded and appreciated the
                    honest post-mortem.
                </p>

                <h2>Looking Forward</h2>

                <p>
                    As we prepare for our next phase of growth, building in public will
                    remain central to our approach. The benefits in terms of community
                    building, accountability, and unexpected connections far outweigh the
                    challenges.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're considering building in public, my advice is simple:
                    start small, be consistent, and remember that authenticity resonates
                    more than perfectly curated updates. The goal isn't to impress
                    people—it's to bring them along on your journey, both the victories
                    and the setbacks.
                </p>
